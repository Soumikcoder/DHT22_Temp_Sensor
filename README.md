This repository contains the code and documentation for a thermometer project developed using Arduino and the DHT22 sensor. The project was undertaken as a mini project for [College Name]'s electronics or computer science curriculum.

## About

The Arduino thermometer with DHT22 sensor project aims to create a digital thermometer using Arduino Uno and the DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor. The project provides real-time temperature and humidity readings, displaying them on serial monitor.

## Components

The following components are used in this project:

- Arduino Uno
- DHT22 Temperature and Humidity Sensor
- Breadboard and Jumper Wires

## Features

- Real-time temperature and humidity monitoring
- Display of temperature and humidity on an LCD screen
- Simple and intuitive interface
- Easy to set up and configure

## Installation and Setup

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Connect the DHT22 sensor and LCD display to the Arduino Uno following the wiring diagram provided in the documentation.
2. Upload the Arduino sketch (`temp_sensor.ino`) to the Arduino Uno using the Arduino IDE.
3. Power up the Arduino Uno board.
4. The Serial monitor will display real-time temperature and humidity readings.

## Usage

The thermometer is ready to use once the sketch is uploaded to the Arduino Uno board. Users can view temperature and humidity readings directly on the Serial Monitor. The project can be extended to include additional features or integrated into other projects as needed.
